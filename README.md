SUMMARY

We have made available here a series of scripts to analyze non-VDJ insertions in human antibody transcripts.

The scripts are primarily intended as reference for manuscript "Different classes of genomic inserts contribute to human antibody diversity" rather than a stand-alone application.

The input of the pipeline is 300 bp paired-end reads coming from a target amplicon of the antibody transcripts (heavy or light chain). Data can be found at SRA db: PRJNA638005 accession number.

The general overview of the pipeline is represented in 'SuppFig_vdj_insert_Illumina.pdf' file. These scripts were run on Linux machines.
